I am a master's student at [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/en/). My research explores the intersection of urban data science and urban spatial perception, focusing on enhancing accessibility and the quality of urban environments. My recent projects include using 360-degree image capture, enhanced semantic segmentation, and predictive modeling techniques based on XGBoost and SHAP to analyze the relationship between visual elements and safety perceptions in underground public spaces; and investigating the relationship between the built environment and cycling behavior using data from SVI and Strava Metro. My work has been published at [CAADRIA](https://caadria2024.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/272-EXPLORING-VISUAL-FACTORS-INFLUENCING-WOMEN_S-PERCEIVED-INSECURITY-IN-METRO-STATIONS-AND-ADJACENT-BUILT-ENVIRONMENTS.pdf) and [CDRF](https://www.digitalfutures.world/conference/18.html).

In addition to being a researcher, I am a designer and architect with a strong foundation in architecture and urban design. Before pursuing my Master's at Politecnico di Milano, I earned a Bachelor's degree in architecture, which laid the foundation for my interest in conducting computer-aided design in architecture and urban areas. During both my Bachelor's and Master's periods, I conducted several architecture and urban design projects. You can find my profile here: [Profile].
